# Multi_Objective_Genetic_Algorithm_with_Benchmark_Functions
The Goal of this assignment is to implement Multi Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) using python. MOGA is a state of the art algorithm and is used extensively in the Optimization industry. Most of the multi objective algorithms can be solved as a single objective problem but it cannot be assumed that the goal of the multi objective algorithm is to nd out the best optimal solution corresponding to the given objective function but rather the goal is to nd the best solution by using trade-o between the solutions. In this assignement the MOGA is implemented using Python and nine Multi-Objective Functions listed below.
 1. Zitzler{Deb{Thiele's function 1
 2. Zitzler{Deb{Thiele's function 2
 3. Zitzler{Deb{Thiele's function 3
 4. Zitzler{Deb{Thiele's function 4
 5. Zitzler{Deb{Thiele's function 5
 6. Zitzler{Deb{Thiele's function 6
 7. Schaer function 1
 8. Schaer function 2
 9. Disc Brake Design Problem
 10. Binh and Korn Probelm
